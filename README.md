MaskID: Face Mask Detection System using CNN

üåü Overview

MaskID is a deep learning project utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately detect whether individuals in an image are wearing a face mask or not. This system is developed using TensorFlow/Keras and is trained on a public dataset, making it ideal for applications like real-time monitoring of public health compliance in enclosed spaces or public transport.

The project achieves a test accuracy of approximately 92%.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Language: Python

Core Libraries: TensorFlow 2.x, Keras

Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV (cv2), Pillow (PIL)

Data Source: Face Mask Dataset (Kaggle)

üìÅ Project Workflow

The solution is implemented entirely within the main.ipynb Jupyter Notebook and follows these key steps:

1. Data Acquisition and Preparation

The project uses the Kaggle API to download the face-mask-dataset.zip.

The raw images are organized into two classes: with_mask (3725 images) and without_mask (3828 images).

Labeling: Images with masks are assigned the numerical label 1, and those without a mask are labeled 0.

2. Image Preprocessing

All images undergo uniform preprocessing steps to ensure they are suitable for the CNN model:

Resizing: Images are resized to a fixed resolution of 128x128 pixels.

Format Conversion: Images are converted to RGB format.

Array Conversion: The image data and labels are converted into NumPy arrays (X for features, Y for labels).

Scaling/Normalization: Pixel intensity values (0-255) are scaled down to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.

4. Training and Evaluation

Training Split: Data is split into 80% for training (X_train, Y_train) and 20% for testing (X_test, Y_test).

Compilation: The model uses the adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss.

Training: The model was trained for 5 epochs.

Performance:

Final Training Accuracy: ~93.08%

Final Test Accuracy: ~92.19%

üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas opencv-python pillow scikit-learn kaggle


Running the Notebook

Kaggle Setup: Obtain your kaggle.json credentials file.

Download Data: The notebook handles the data download automatically if your Kaggle API is set up. Otherwise, manually download the "Face Mask Dataset" and extract it to a directory named data/ containing with_mask and without_mask subdirectories.

Execute Cells: Run all cells in main.ipynb sequentially.

Prediction: The final section of the notebook includes a simple predictive system where you can input the path to any image, and the model will output its classification.

# Example of prediction output:
# Path of the image to be predicted: /path/to/your/image.jpg
# [[0.49811754 0.47740024]]
# 0
# The person in the image is not wearing a mask


üìà Model Performance Visualization

The notebook generates plots to show the training and validation loss and accuracy over the epochs, which helps in identifying potential overfitting and model stability.

Developed as a foundational project in CNN and image classification.
